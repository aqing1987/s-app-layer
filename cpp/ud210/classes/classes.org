* Classes
A class in C++ is a user defined data type. It can have data and 
functions.

The nice thing about C++ classes, the default is to make all members
private. This means only other memebers of the class can access the
data.

*We can use functions to access the data in a class.*

Functions that access and/or modify data values in classes are called
mutators. Check this page to learn more about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method][Mutators]].

functions in classes are also called methods.
