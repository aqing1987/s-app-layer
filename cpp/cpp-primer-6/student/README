Containment or Private Inheritance?

Given that you can model a has-a relationship either with containment or with
private inheritance, which should you use? Most C++ programmers prefer conta-
inment.
First, it's easier to follow.
Second, inheritance can raise problems, particularly if a class inherits from
more than one base class. All in all, you're less likely to run into trouble
usig containment.

In general, you should use containment to model a has-a relationship. You shou-
ld use private inheritance if the new class needs to access protected members
in the original class or if it needs to redefine virtual functions.
