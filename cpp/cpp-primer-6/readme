OOP is a programming style that you can use to some degree with any language.

Certainly, you can incorporate many OOP ideas into ordinary C programs.

For example, separate-compilation
in which a header file contains a structure prototype along with the prototypes
for functions to manipulate that structure. The main() function simplly defines
variables of that structure type and uses the associated functions to handle
those variables; main() does not directly access structure members. In essence,
that example defines an abstract type that places the storage format and the
function prototypes in a header file, hiding the actual data representation
from main().
