task:

test if unrelated echo will be captured by fgets after popen


The popen() function opens a process by creating a pipe, forking, and
invoking the shell.

The popen() function returns NULL if the fork(2) or pipe(2) calls fail,
or if it cannot allocate memory.

if command "xxx" not exist

fp = popen("xxx", "r");
fp still valid, but output "sh: 1: xxx: not found"

test steps:
1. ./echo-always.sh
2. ./check-sh-result

only sync-s echo can be captured by fgets after popen.
