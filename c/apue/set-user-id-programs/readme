1. compile 8-14 into the executable file tsys
2. compile 8-15 into the executable file printuids
3.
$ tsys printuids
$ su
# chown root tsys
# chmod u+s tsys
# ls -l tsys
# exit
$ tsys printuids

Note: When /bin/sh is bash version 2, the previous example doesn't
work, because bash will reset the effective user ID to the real user
ID when they don't match.
