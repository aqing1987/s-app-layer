#+options: ^:nil

* issue description
after ubuntu upgraded from 14.04 to 16.04, I cannot boot virtualbox anymore.

The error info as below:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
The VM session was aborted.  
Result Code:  NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)
#+END_SRC

* solution
Re-setup the virtualbox kernel module by executing

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup
#+END_SRC

* reason
The virtualbox linux kernel driver mismatched the newly upgraded kernel.
