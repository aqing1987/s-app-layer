* Look Up Function Doc String
The following function you will use often when you code elisp.
*Alt+x describe-function* or *[Ctrl+h f]*, then type the function
name.

(if the function name is under cursor, it's the default. You don't
need to type the name, just hit *Enter*)

You can use the asterisk *\** as a wildcard when looking up 
function doc. For example, type *[Ctrl+h f *file TAB]* and emacs
will list all functions whose name ends in "file".

Once the function's doc string page comes up, you can jump to the
function's location in source code by clicking on underlined file
name (or press TAB to move your cursor to the link then press
ENTER)

* Look Up Variable Doc String
*Alt+x describe-variable* or *[Ctrl+h v]* for doc string of 
variables.

Some words (symbols) in elisp source code are variable, not 
function.

For example, *sentence-end-double-space* is a variable.
