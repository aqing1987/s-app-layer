#+title: fix buildbot multi-core compile not work issue
#+options: ^:nil

* description
I use buildbot for daily build task. But the multi-core compile feature
is not effective.

* analysis

** multi-core compile in terminal test
We use a build script to accept multi-core compile parameter. as below:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./build-sh -j 16
#+END_SRC

add we add debug info in `build-sh'
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
if [ $num -gt 1 ]; then
    echo "*** $num cpu core compiling ***"
    make -j$num V=s
else
    make V=s
fi
#+END_SRC

It proves that multi-core compile in terminal works.

** multi-core compile in buildbot test
and we write the buildbot master.cfg as below:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
makeall = steps.ShellCommand(
    name = "make-all",
    command = ["./build-sh", "-j 16"],
    haltOnFailure = True,
    description = "make all" )
#+END_SRC

By analyzing the buildbot stdio log file, we found that the multi-core
compile feature is not in use.

* fix

Don't specify the command with a list of argv strings, specify it with
a single string.

modified as below:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
makeall = steps.ShellCommand(
    name = "make-all",
    command = "./build-sh -j 16",
    haltOnFailure = True,
    description = "make all" )
#+END_SRC

and do
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ cd buildbot
$ buildbot reconfig master/
#+END_SRC

Then the multi-core compile feature can be effective.
