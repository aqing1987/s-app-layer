#+title: Org mode set table of contents level
#+options: ^:nil

* reference
+ http://orgmode.org/org.html

search *toc* in the page, and locates:
#+BEGIN_SRC html
toc:
     Toggle inclusion of the table of contents, or set the level limit
     (org-export-with-toc)
#+END_SRC

* why I need it
If the paper has 5 levels of headings, the table of contents will also show
5 levels of headings.

It's ugly, we only need 2 levels in the table of contents.

* fix
keep the code below to you .emacs, and then restart emacs. Try to export your
org-mode document again, you will get what you want.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq org-export-with-toc 2)
#+END_SRC
