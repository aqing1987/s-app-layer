* Changes in emacs25.2
This is mainly a bug-fix release, but there are some other changes.

+ 'find-library', 'help-function-def' and 'help-variable-def' now run
  'find-function-after-hook'.

+ New basic face 'fixed-pitch-serif', for a fixed-width font with serifs.
  The 'Info-quoted' and 'tex-verbatim' faces inherit from it by default.

+ New variable 'use-default-font-for-symbols', for backward compatibility.
  This variable allows you to get back pre-Emacs 25 behavior where the
  font for displaying symbol and punctuation characters was always
  selected according to your fontset setup.  By default, Emacs 25 tries
  to use the default face's font for such characters, if it supports
  them, disregarding the fontsets.  Set this variable to nil to disable
  this and get back the old behavior.

+ 'electric-quote-mode' is no longer suppressed in a buffer whose
  coding system cannot represent curved quote characters.
  Instead, users can deal with the unrepresentable characters in the
  usual way when they save the buffer.

+ New variable 'inhibit-compacting-font-caches'.
  Set this variable to a non-nil value to speed up display of characters
  using large fonts, at the price of a larger memory footprint.

+ The version number of CC Mode has been changed from 5.33 to
  5.32.99, although the software itself hasn't changed.  This aims to
  reduce confusion with the standalone CC Mode 5.33 (available from
  http://cc-mode.sourceforge.net), which is a more mature version than
  the one included in Emacs 25.2.
* get the src
download the stable package emacs-25.2.tar.xz from
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/

* remove old emacs
Remove previous Emacs if any before getting started, I used emacs-24.5
before, so it's needed to be removed:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ cd software/emacs-24.5
$ sudo make uninstall
#+END_SRC
* install dependencies
emacs24 and 25 use the same build dependencies:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ sudo apt install build-essential checkinstall
$ sudo apt-get build-dep emacs24
#+END_SRC

* install emacs-25.2
#+begin_src sh
$ tar xf emacs-25.2.tar.xz
emacs-25.2$ ./configure
emacs-25.2$ make
emacs-25.2$ sudo make install
#+end_src

* start
** start with window
#+begin_src sh
$ emacs
#+end_src
** start without window
#+begin_src sh
$ emacs -nw
#+end_src
