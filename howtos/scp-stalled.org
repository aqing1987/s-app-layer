#+title: scp stalled solution

* description
When transferring large files(for example mksysb images) usingscp through a 
firewall, the scp connection stalls.

* cause
The reason for scp to stall, is because scp greedily grabs asmuch bandwith of 
the network as possible when it transfers files,any delay caused by the 
network switch of the firewall can easilymake the TCP connection stalled.

* Solution
There’s a solution to this problem: Add “-l 8192″ to the scpcommand.

Adding the option “-l 8192″ limits the scp session bandwith upto 
8192 Kbit/second, which seems to work safe and fast enough 
(upto 1 MB/second)
