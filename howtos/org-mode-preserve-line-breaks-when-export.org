#+title: Org mode preserve line breaks when export
#+options: ^:nil

* reference
+ http://orgmode.org/org.html

Search '\n' when you opened the page. and locates to:
#+BEGIN_SRC html
\n:
    Toggles whether to preserve line breaks (org-export-preserve-breaks).
#+END_SRC

* why I need it
When I write org-mode note, I can control the line width (80 columns I prefer).
But when I export to html, the text line will reach to the full screen width.
It's really a bad experience.

* fix
keep the code below to you .emacs, and then restart emacs. Try to export your
org-mode document again, you will get what you want.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq org-export-preserve-breaks t)
#+END_SRC
