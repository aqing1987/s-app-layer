* Obtaining PID of peer connected to a Unix domain socket
A program that listens on a Unix domain socket can accept obtain
the client credentials (pid, uid, gid).


** Easy way
The easy way is for the server to call getsockopt on an accepted
client socket.
#+BEGIN_SRC c
  getsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_PEERCRED, ...)
#+END_SRC

as shown in recv-easy.c.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  % ./recv-easy  # in window 1
  % ./send-easy  # in window 2
#+END_SRC

On window 1 you'll see messages like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  Credentials from SO_PEERCRED: pid=31807, euid=1000, egid=1000
#+END_SRC

The man page for socket(7) notes
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The returned credentials are those that were in effect at the
time of the call to connect(2).
#+END_QUOTE
