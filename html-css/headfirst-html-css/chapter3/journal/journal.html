<!--
     1. plan the structure of your web pages before you start
     tying in the content. Start with a sketch, then create an outline,
     and finally write the html.
     2. plan your page starting with the large, block elements, and then
     refine with inline elements.
     3. <p>, <blockquote>, <ol>, <ul>, and <li> are all block elements.
     4. <q> and <em> are inline elements.
     5. <br> element for linebreak, and <br> is a 'void' element
     6. make an html list using two elements in combination: use <ol> with <li>
     for an ordered list; use <ul> with <li> for an unordered list.
     7. use character entities for special characters in your html content.

      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some
      <strong>interesting places</strong> on the way:

    <!--
         unordered list -> ul
         ordered list -> ol
         list item -> li

    <ol>
      <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
      <li>Magic City, ID</li>
      <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
      <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
      <li>Why, AZ</li>
      <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
    </ol>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
    </p>
    <!-- <blockquote> creates a separate block like <p>
         does, plus it indents the text a bit to make it look
         more like a quote.
       -->
    <blockquote>
      Passing cars, <br>
      When you can't see, <br>
      May get you, <br>
      A glimpse, <br>
      Of eternity. <br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I definitely won't be passing any cars.

      My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything
      packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to
      bring a whole lot with me:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>cell phone</li>
      <li>iPod</li>
      <li>digital camera</li>
      <li>protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A
      journey of a thousand miles begins with on Segway.</q>
